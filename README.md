# SecretOfManaRandomizer
It's a multi-mode randomizer for the SNES game Secret of Mana.

# Building
Check out and load the .sln in Visual Studio.  I've been using VS 2017.  Anything later than that should theoretically also work.

I'll be posting releases, so unless you're actively working on the project, you shouldn't need to build it.

# Using
Instructions will be here eventually for how to use the rando.  For now join the discord and ask if you have questions.

Releases will be posted here (no music pack)

and also here: https://secretofmanaancientcave.blogspot.com/ (with music pack)

We run a weekly open world seed, and this is currently the main source of general information, questions, etc. for the randomizer.
